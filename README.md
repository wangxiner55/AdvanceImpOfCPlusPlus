 Some advanced C++ design patterns and programming methods


This is a camek project, but there is no complex architecture in it, so it is possible to open it by importing it directly into vs.

The implementation of this comes from what I have collected and learned on the web, and is some of the better C++ code in my current cognitive scope category.

In each main function I mark the specific URL, and my comments on the current code implementation.
